		<h2>About the project</h2>
		<p>This project was my first experience working with Virtual Reality. The premise of the game is simple: you play minigolf in Virtual Reality. There are a handful of short holes to complete, fitted with various obstacles 
		such as walls, sand traps, and water hazards. Your strokes are kept track of and displayed at the end of the hole.</p>

		<h2>The technical aspects</h2>
		<p>Much like the AR project, this was a mixture of familiar and new to me. Unlike AR, however, working with VR was much easier and more familiar to me since it all ran directly inside Unity, rather than having to 
		be built to my phone and running there. This made testing in VR much much easier and faster than AR. The biggest challenge of creating minigolf was the interactions between the club and the ball. 
		Originally, I had planned for the interaction to be purely collision based, handled entirely by Unity's physics engine. This, however, proved to be nearly impossible. Unity struggled to accurately process 
		any sort of collision between the club and the ball when the club was being swung at even a moderately quick pace. Even a gentle putting motion sometimes went completely hay-wire under Unity's control. The main 
		issue was clipping; if the club was moving too quickly (which wasn't hard to achieve since anything past a slight tap was too quick for the physics engine) the club would completely clip inside of the ball and often 
		cause the ball to launch off in the wrong direction or sometimes completely off the map with great velocity. Even with the highest-precision collision tracking settings turned on, it still proved to be too much
		for Unity's physics engine. So I had to improvise. I ended having to code my own interactions between the club and the ball. This was done by detecting the exact moment the club came into contact with the ball and 
		determining the clubs velocity at the point of contact. It then applied that velocity to the ball, sending the ball in the correct direction with an appropriate speed. After some fine tuning, this system actually 
		felt and handled very well. I was very proud with the solution I had come up with. Past this initial problem, the rest of development went smoothly. The ball-in-the-hole interactions were straight forward, and the 
		scoring was simple. Most of the development time past the initial putting physics was spent designing and creating the handful of holes, as well as they various obstacles. Past normal wall obstacles, sand traps 
		slow your ball down, and water hazards rests your ball its last position. The slowing down of the ball inside the sand traps was handled using a special physics material that added friction to the ball, which 
		meant no additional code was required to achieve the slowing effect.</p>
