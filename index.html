		<h1>My name is Jacob Malburne. Welcome to my portfolio.</h1>
		
		<p>I've been interested in the technical side of video games since I was a child. I would spend hours upon hours just walking around my favorite games, not necessarily <i>playing</i> them, but more just 
		exploring them and thinking about how the game was made behind the scene, fascinated by the concept of being able to create a world where reality is under my control. During elementary school, I 
		acted upon my interests by messing around with child-friendly game development programs such as the drag-and-drop coding engine Scratch and later the more complicated ROBLOX engine which utilized written LUA. That being said, 
		LUA was my first experience with written code, and ever since my first 'print("Hello World!")' in ROBLOX LUA my love for coding and game development has blossomed. Later on in High School and College, I would start 
		working with more professional engines such as Unity, GameMaker, and Monogame.</p>

		<h2>What motivates me?</h2>
		<p>There are many things that motivate me. Things like always striving to be better and do better. Always wanted to expand on my knowledge so I can work and create more efficiently in the future. Wanting to learn 
		and experiment with knew technologies to discover and open new doors that I never knew existed. But above all, my main motivating is simply the love for what I do. I'm never bored while programming and working 
		on a game. Every new function and method I write, every bug I fix, every system I create, I love every second of it. I'm driven both by the satisfaction of completing a goal that seemed so far away when I set it 
		for myself, and by the ever fleeting feeling of being <i>actually</i> finished with a project. No matter how much you do, you always feel like you could add more, or make the existing things better, and I love that. 
		I feel like I never run out of things to do and create because no matter how much I do, I could always do more, and the more I can do, the more motivation I get. That's whats great about programming, there's never a 
		point where you go "and we're done!" because no matter what, you can always either add or improve.</p>
